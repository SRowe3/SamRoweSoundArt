			<h1>Biodata Sonification</h1>
			<p>I am currently experimenting with the use of biodata sonification in my work, so far I have experimented with a few ideas, culminating in the pieces below.</p>

				<h1>Generative Piece and Ititial Experiments</h1>
		
				<p> This was made as part of a module during my third year using max4live. The plant in this senario is essentialy only acting as a trigger for randomness, changing the random seed during sections of the piece. I have attached the write-up for this piece for more infomation on the concepts and code, as well as a general overview of this module. The write-up for the piece and module can be seen

					<h1>"In C"Quartet</h1>
					<p> While thinking of how the plants could be used I had the idea of using them to play Terry Ryles "In C". There are a few reasons for this being a good first experiment. The piece is designed such that each elemet works with every other element withouth explicet communication between "performers", the piece is supposed to have a "random" or at least "psudo-random" element to it and I could essentialy recycle code from my first experiment as , once agin, the plant would just be acting as a random trigger to select a new section. While this is a bit of a tangent and might not further the actual sonification I think it works well and blends well with the philosiphy of Terry Ryley. More infomation is available
