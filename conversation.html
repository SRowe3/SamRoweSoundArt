		<h1>Conversation</h1>
		<p> This is a piece that demonstrates my interest in degradation, particularly how tape can be used to cause the decay of audio. William Basinkisis' "Disintegration Loops" is probably one of the most influential albums for my work and this piece is the result of an attempt to create an installation centered around the decay of audio through tape. The piece also echoes "I am Sitting In A Room" By Alvin Lucier. This piece was featured as part of LCB Depots' "Sound 2024" Exhibition.

		<h1>Program Note</h1>
		<p class="centert">
			"Conversation explores the erosion that time inflicts on our voices and ideas,
			the noises people make are recorded onto the tape only to be repeated,
			degraded and overwritten eventually being lost in the noise. The result
			represents a conversation between the fleating present and the unintellagable past"
