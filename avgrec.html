		<h1>Average / Long Exposure Field Recordings</h1>
		<p>I have been experimenting with creating an "average" recording of a place, largely inspired by the idea of long-exposure photography I want to take a field recording and have a way of compressing it into a single sound. I have experimented with several ways of doing this including takeing the various partials of the sound and averaging their pitch and amplitude to create a "chord" of the average pitches as well as creating a system that only records the loudest sounds. If I coutinue to develop these ideas they will culminate in some form of instullation with long-exposure photoes and long-exposure field recording of the same place at the same time being whown</p>

			<p>This is the first recording I have made. While it technicly works it isnt particually interesting, this is mostly due to the image not being very interesting but also the soundis, as intended, very simple.
